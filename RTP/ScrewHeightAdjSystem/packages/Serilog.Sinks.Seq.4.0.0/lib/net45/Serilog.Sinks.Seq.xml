            <param name="loggerSinkConfiguration">The logger configuration.</param>
            <param name="serverUrl">The base URL of the Seq server that log events will be written to.</param>
            <param name="restrictedToMinimumLevel">The minimum log event level required 
            in order to write an event to the sink.</param>
            <param name="batchPostingLimit">The maximum number of events to post in a single batch.</param>
            <param name="period">The time to wait between checking for event batches.</param>
            <param name="bufferBaseFilename">Path for a set of files that will be used to buffer events until they
            can be successfully transmitted across the network. Individual files will be created using the
            pattern <paramref name="bufferBaseFilename"/>*.json, which should not clash with any other filenames
            in the same directory.</param>
            <param name="apiKey">A Seq <i>API key</i> that authenticates the client to the Seq server.</param>
            <param name="bufferSizeLimitBytes">The maximum amount of data, in bytes, to which the buffer
            log file for a specific date will be allowed to grow. By default no limit will be applied.</param>
            <param name="eventBodyLimitBytes">The maximum size, in bytes, that the JSON representation of
            an event may take before it is dropped rather than being sent to the Seq server. Specify null for no limit.
            The default is 265 KB.</param>
            <param name="controlLevelSwitch">If provided, the switch will be updated based on the Seq server's level setting
            for the corresponding API key. Passing the same key to MinimumLevel.ControlledBy() will make the whole pipeline
            dynamically controlled. Do not specify <paramref name="restrictedToMinimumLevel"/> with this setting.</param>
            <param name="messageHandler">Used to construct the HttpClient that will send the log messages to Seq.</param>
            <param name="retainedInvalidPayloadsLimitBytes">A soft limit for the number of bytes to use for storing failed requests.  
            The limit is soft in that it can be exceeded by any single error payload, but in that case only that single error
            payload will be retained.</param>
            <param name="compact">Use the compact log event format defined by
            <a href="https://github.com/serilog/serilog-formatting-compact">Serilog.Formatting.Compact</a>. Has no effect on
            durable log shipping. Requires Seq 3.3+.</param>
            <param name="queueSizeLimit">The maximum number of events that will be held in-memory while waiting to ship them to
            Seq. Beyond this limit, events will be dropped. The default is 100,000. Has no effect on
            durable log shipping.</param>
